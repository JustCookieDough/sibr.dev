In theory, this will use a $1 RP2040 microcontroller to display games from the internet simultaneously on a monitor, Nintendo Switch, Game Boy Advance, and serial port. Implementing this was way more work than I expected, and currently it just replays a game from flash on a monitor. I'd like to get back to this eventually, though, and I did make quite a bit of progress on Switch support (though I didn't finish it).
