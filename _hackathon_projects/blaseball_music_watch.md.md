comments: '"I actually listened to this nonsense for a surprisingly long time. The tracks only playing when the team is up to bat was very clever!" - Joel Clark'

Generates music based on the games played that day. The day starts silent, but once a team scores their first point, they are randomly assigned a short loop track. Each team's track will only play when that team is batting. As more teams get points on the board, more music is added, until there is too much. Only tested on my iMac. ("Unfinished". I had more plans for cursing the watch page visually as the music goes on, as well as more track options, but this is as far as I got before the deadline.)
