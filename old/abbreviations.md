title: SIBR team abbreviations
---

SIBR, in our efforts to ever support and expand the ways in which the splort of blaseball can be understood and enjoyed, [recently undertook a community survey](https://twitter.com/SIBROfficial/status/1319736495402516481) to determine a set of common abbreviations for each team for use in SIBR tools and community projects.

These abbreviations, largely based off of community popularity, are being established for all teams currently or formerly in the ILB:

| Team                     | Abbreviation |
| ------------------------ | ------------ |
| Baltimore Crabs          | CRAB         |
| Boston Flowers           | BOS          |
| Breckenridge Jazz Hands  | JAZZ         |
| Canada Moist Talkers     | CAN          |
| Charleston Shoe Thieves  | CHST         |
| Chicago Firefighters     | CHI          |
| Dallas Steaks            | STK          |
| Hades Tigers             | TGRS         |
| Hawai'i Fridays          | FRI          |
| Hellmouth Sunbeams       | HELL         |

| Philly Pies              | PIES         |

| Unlimited Tacos          | TACO         |
| Yellowstone Magic        | YELL         |

In addition, these historical teams without currently established fanbases have been assigned the following abbreviations:

| Team                   | Abbreviation |
| ---------------------- | ------------ |
| THE SHELLED ONE'S PODS | PODS         |
| The Hall Stars         | STAR         |

Future teams will have their abbreviations for use in SIBR records determined following their first season of play in the ILB and the development of their communities and fanbases.
